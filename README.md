# ZigZag 
ZigZag is my 1st year (2019-2020) software project, where I used JAVA to build the program, which makes Finch Robot traverse in a zigzag manner.

## The project workflow included:
1. Gathering requirements from a case study.
2. Creating and documenting the design for the program. [Check out the Design_doc](Design_doc.pdf)
4. Implementing the design using JAVA and Finch API.
5. Testing the software program.
6. Deliver the project within the specified time-line.

## Software development lifecycle used: Waterfall


## Project Outcome:
- Created & Documented the design.
- Successfully implemented the design.
- Successfully tested the design.
